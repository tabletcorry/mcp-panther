## Getting Started

The MCP Panther project is a server implementation for the Model Control Protocol (MCP) that provides integration with Panther Labs services.

## Testing Changes

### Manual Testing

To manually test your changes, you can run the MCP server using:

```bash
uv run fastmcp dev src/mcp_panther/server.py
```

This command runs the server in development mode, which provides additional debugging information and automatically reloads when changes are detected.

Or add the following to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "panther": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "fastmcp",
        "--with",
        "anyascii",
        "--with",
        "aiohttp",
        "--with",
        "gql[aiohttp]",
        "fastmcp",
        "run",
        "/<PATH-TO-MCP-PANTHER-REPO>/src/mcp_panther/server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PANTHER_API_TOKEN": "<TOKEN-HERE>",
        "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL": "https://<INSTANCE-URL-HERE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Debugging

When running the server, you can set the logging level to DEBUG in `server.py` for more detailed logs:

```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,  # Set to INFO for less verbose output
    format="%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",
    stream=sys.stderr,
)
```
To send logs to a file instead, run the server with `--log-file <path>` or set the
`MCP_LOG_FILE` environment variable. Logs from FastMCP, Uvicorn, and other
dependencies will also be written to the configured file.

### Run the Development Server

For testing and development, you can run the MCP server in development mode:

```bash
uv run fastmcp dev src/mcp_panther/server.py
```

This starts the MCP Inspector server and provides an interactive web interface to test its functionality.

### Run as a Standalone Server

You can also run the server directly:

```bash
uv run python -m mcp_panther.server
```

This will start the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Extending Functionality

The MCP Panther server functionality can be extended by adding tools, prompts, and resources.

### Adding New Tools (`mcp_tool`)

Tools are functions that perform specific actions with Panther and are exposed to MCP clients.

1. Create a new Python file in `src/mcp_panther/panther_mcp_core/tools/` or add to an existing one
2. Import the `mcp_tool` decorator from the registry:

```python
from .registry import mcp_tool
```

3. Define your function and annotate it with the `mcp_tool` decorator:

```python
@mcp_tool
async def my_new_tool(param1: str, param2: int = 0) -> dict:
    """
    Description of what this tool does.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of parameter 1
        param2: Description of parameter 2
        
    Returns:
        A dictionary with the results
    """
    # Tool implementation
    result = {"status": "success", "data": [...]}
    return result
```

4. Make sure your tool is imported in `__init__.py` if you created a new file:

```python
# In src/mcp_panther/panther_mcp_core/tools/__init__.py
from . import my_new_module  # Add this line
```

5. Update the `__all__` list if you created a new module:

```python
__all__ = ["alerts", "rules", "data_lake", "sources", "metrics", "users", "my_new_module"]
```

### Adding New Prompts (`mcp_prompt`)

Prompts are functions that generate prompt templates for LLMs.

1. Create a new Python file in `src/mcp_panther/panther_mcp_core/prompts/` or add to an existing one
2. Import the `mcp_prompt` decorator from the registry:

```python
from .registry import mcp_prompt
```

3. Define your function and annotate it with the `mcp_prompt` decorator:

```python
@mcp_prompt
def my_new_prompt(context_info: str) -> str:
    """
    Generate a prompt for a specific task.
    
    Args:
        context_info: Contextual information to include in the prompt
        
    Returns:
        A string containing the prompt template
    """
    return f"""
    You are a security analyst. Here is some context information:
    {context_info}
    
    Based on this information, please analyze the security implications.
    """
```

4. Make sure your prompt is imported in `__init__.py` if you created a new file:

```python
# In src/mcp_panther/panther_mcp_core/prompts/__init__.py
from . import my_new_module  # Add this line
```

5. Update the `__all__` list if you created a new module:

```python
__all__ = ["alert_triage", "my_new_module"]
```

### Adding New Resources (`mcp_resource`)

Resources are functions that provide configuration or data to MCP clients.

1. Create a new Python file in `src/mcp_panther/panther_mcp_core/resources/` or add to an existing one
2. Import the `mcp_resource` decorator from the registry:

```python
from .registry import mcp_resource
```

3. Define your function and annotate it with the `mcp_resource` decorator, specifying the resource path:

```python
@mcp_resource("config://panther/my-resource")
def my_new_resource() -> dict:
    """
    Provide a new resource.
    
    Returns:
        A dictionary with the resource data
    """
    return {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2",
        # More resource data...
    }
```

4. Make sure your resource is imported in `__init__.py` if you created a new file:

```python
# In src/mcp_panther/panther_mcp_core/resources/__init__.py
from . import my_new_module  # Add this line
```

5. Update the `__all__` list if you created a new module:

```python
__all__ = ["config", "my_new_module"]
```

## Code Quality

### Linting with Ruff

The project uses Ruff for linting. You can run linting checks with:

```bash
ruff check .
```

To automatically fix issues:

```bash
ruff check --fix .
```

To format the code:

```bash
ruff format .
```

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
1. **Type Safety**: Include type annotations for parameters and return values
2. **Documentation**: Write clear docstrings and maintain consistent terminology (e.g., use "log type schemas" instead of mixing "schemas" and "log types")
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling, especially for external service interactions
4. **Performance**: Use async functions for I/O operations and limit response lengths to prevent context window flooding

### Development Process
1. **Testing**: Test changes thoroughly before submitting PRs
2. **Logging**: Use appropriate log levels for debugging and monitoring
3. **Tool Design**: Write clear, focused tool descriptions to help LLMs make appropriate choices

## Common Issues

- **Import Errors**: Make sure new modules are properly imported in `__init__.py` files.
- **MCP Registration**: All tools, prompts, and resources must be decorated with the appropriate decorator to be registered with MCP.
- **Unused Imports**: Use `__all__` lists to avoid unused import warnings.
